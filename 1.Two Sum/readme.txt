Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


输入一个数组和target，要在一个数组中找到两个数字，其和为target，从小到大输出数组中两个数字的位置。题目中假设有且仅有一个答案。
